Simple CLI that displays horrible workflow practices using zoolander quotes

![Zoolander](https://raw.github.com/wookiecooking/commitlander/master/zoolander.jpg)

Instead of writing useful commit messages, why not use zoolander quotes! This package simply commits a git directory with a quote from zoolander. Adding new ones is as easy as updating a array in lib/quotes.

Doesn't work on anything that doesn't have bash. Windows users encouraged to fix.

### Install

`npm install -g commitlander`

### Usage

* `cd some-git-project && git add -A`
* `commitlander`
* ` commited: "At the Derek Zoolander Center For Children Who Can't Read Good And Wanna Learn To Do Other Stuff Good Too, we teach you that there's more to life than being really, really good looking." `
