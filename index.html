<p>Instead of writing useful commit messages, why not use zoolander quotes! This package simply commits a git directory with a quote from zoolander. Adding new ones is as easy as updating a array in lib/quotes.</p>

<p>Doesn't work on anything that doesn't have bash. Windows users encouraged to fix.</p>

<li><p>How can we be expected to teach children to learn how to read if they can't even fit inside the building?",</p></li>

<li>"I don't wanna hear your excuses! The building has to be at least... three times bigger than this! ",</li>
<li>"Look, I gotta go pee, but I'd really like to continue talking about this conversation when I come back.",</li>
<li>"You can read minds?",</li>
<li>"[looking at the sky] Who am I?... [phone rings] God?",</li>
